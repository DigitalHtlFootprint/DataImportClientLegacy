Note: If you search for a version which works with the legacy database which was a base for this project, I need to refer you to [this](https://github.com/DigitalHtlFootprint/DataImportClientLegacy) fork.
This repository only works with its own [DatabaseSetup.sql](/readme-files/DatabaseSetup.sql).

`DataImportClient` is a console based application, which allows to import data from various sources into a SQL database.

## External services used
- For drawing most of the menu [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) did a great job, on serving as a documentation on [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters).
- Headers within the application were created using the website [patorjk.com](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/). This website allows to create big text in many different styles and fonts.
